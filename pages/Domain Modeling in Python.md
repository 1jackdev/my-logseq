- Encapsulating behavior by using abstractions is a powerful tool for making code more expressive, more testable, and easier to maintain.
- Layering
	- Presentation Layer -> Business Logic -> Database Layer
- Dependency Inversion Principle
	- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
	- Abstractions should not depend on details. Instead, details should depend on abstractions.
- High-level Modules
	- code that are organization really cares about
		- at sennder, this is the code that creates and updates domain entities (SP, CC, fin docs)
